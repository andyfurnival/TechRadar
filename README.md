# [Tech Radar](http://gpimblott.github.io/TechRadar/)

Welcome to TechRadar!

TechRadar started with a few aims:

* Share experience with technologies across a community
* Record the technologies used on projects
* Promote a common view of technologies across a community

Designed as a simple Web Application it allows the open exchange of views on technologies either by 'voting' on a technology or
by entering a comment based detailing your views/experiences.

Try it now : [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy) (Default credentials - username:admin password:letmein)

It allows users to:
* Add technologies that you are interested in and associate with categories and projects
* Users can Comment on the technologies
* Users can Vote on whether they think they should be adopted, trialed or avoided.  
* Users with the correct permissions can then set the 'official' status with a rationale for each technology
* Users can indicate that they have used a technology

The implementation is extremely flexible with all values (e.g. status values) changable in the data and via the management interface.

## New features
* Users skills tracking - Each user can indicate that they have used a technology
* Technology version information tracked - comments and projects can be linked to a specific version of a tool
* ADFS integration
* License information for technologies

## Planned future features

* Dashboard Enhancements

## Design

TechRadar is a Web Application developed using NodeJS, Passport, Bootstrap and PostgreSQL.  
It consists of two layers:

1. Web Layers 
2. API REST Services

The web application calls the API REST services using ajax.

## Pre-requisites

Tech Radar is a NodeJS application

* NodeJS
* PostgreSQL database (other databases are available and will probably work with small changes to the schema)

## Configuration

The following environment variables can be set

`COOKIE_KEY = xxxxxxxxxxx` : The secret key to use for cookie encryption - uses an insecure value if not defined

`GOOGLE_ID = xxxxxxxxxxx` : Google Analytics tracking code. GA is turned off if not defined

To enable Azure AD sign-in, set the following environment variables:
 
`AZURE_IDENTITY_METADATA=https://login.microsoftonline.com/YOUR_TENANT_NAME_OR_ID/.well-known/openid-configuration`

`AZURE_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx`

`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=`

`AZURE_RETURN_URL=https://xxxxxxxxxxx.com/auth/openid/return`

If these are not defined AD integration is turned off

Additional Azure AD settings can be found in [configAzureAD.js](src/utils/configAzureAD.js)

## Installation

Installation is as follows:

1. Provision a node environment and PostgreSQL database
2. Define the following environment variables; either by creating a process.env in the root directory or defining standard environment variables
   * DATABASE_URL
3. Deploy code to target environment
4. Run `database/runMigrations.js up` to create all the required tables
5. Run `database/dbtestdata.js` to create some test data if required
6. Use `npm test` to run unit tests.
7. Run `node server.js | bunyan` to start application

Deploying the code to your preferred NodeJS environment (personally I use OpenShift and Heroku)
